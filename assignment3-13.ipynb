You get a \"KeyError\" exception when trying to transform that \"out-of-vocabulary\" term. You should ignore these terms: one way to do this is by wrapping your embedding call with a try/except statement that catches the KeyError and just ignores that word, and continues processing.\n",

If for some reason there are no input terms remaining (they are all out-of-vocabulary) just return 0.\n",
